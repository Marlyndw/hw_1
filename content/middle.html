          <p class="lead">Aspiring software developer; my background is in mechanical engineering. I started my career in the utility industry as a QA engineer validating natural gas assets for PG&E, from there I transitioned over to the project management space as a project engineer overseeing million dollar projects. Continuing my work in project management space as a contracted field engineer for PG&E I ran 5 crews and managed their annual budget. Currently Iâ€™m a project management in the construction development space, looking to make a transition to softeare. It's very clear that software is the future.</p>
